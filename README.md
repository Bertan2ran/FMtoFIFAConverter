# FMtoFIFAConverter
analysis of similarity between players stats in Football manager and FIFA and if significant correlation, a converter.

I've always been used to play FIFA, and therefore can easily assess a players ability in FIFA. I've played football manager for a while now, 
and i simply can't convert the ratings in my head over to my FIFA brain, so to speak. Assuming that the general idea of a players quality and
skills are the same in both games, I want to analyze, if there is a neat transformation from FM over to FIFA, or if there is too much variance.
If there is a good fit, i will be able to generalize over to new players on my saves, and then assess them much more quickly with my trained FIFA eyes!

1. A scraper must be made to get values of FIFA and FM ratings. 
2. A model for converting must be made.
3. A program for taking a picture as input and reading values from it, as i also need to find a way to quickly put values into the converter, as it would
   get way too tedious to input 20+ stats for every player every time i want to assess a player.
